###  About the game

YellowBird, is an infinite sideScroller, where the players aim is to finish with the utmost highest score they can achive and complete.
The project has originally been made for a friend, who wished to play games as a security chief, but common websites are blocked off
where games can be played, and this version offered him to enjoy night-shifts as well as keep himself awake during these harsh times!

### Project Goal

Within this project the aim was to make a game for a friend, but as well as improve programming skills overall by making the game
without any tutorials online and purly sticking with documentation that is available on the internet as well as knowledge gained
from previouly established "Game Jam's" Projects.
